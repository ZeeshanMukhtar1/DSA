## Introduction to Big O Notation

Big O notation is a way to describe the efficiency of algorithms. It helps us understand how the performance of an algorithm scales with the size of the input.

## Why Big O Notation?

Understanding Big O notation allows us to:

- Compare the efficiency of different algorithms.
- Predict how an algorithm will perform as the input size grows.
- Make informed decisions about which algorithm to use in a given situation.

## What is Big O Notation?

Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or space requirements in the worst-case scenario.

In later chapters, we will explore different types of Big O notation and how to calculate them.
